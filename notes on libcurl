All this stuff is installed in github codebase so writing notes on how 
to set it up again
libcurl is the basic library for adding http requests to any c++ program
curlpp is a wrapper library that makes it easier to do object oriented 
stuff with libcurl
dpkg -S libcurl shows which files are owned by package libcurl and where
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev how to install libcurl
curlpp comes as a zip or a tar so I just have it in the repo for now.
